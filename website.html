    <section id="learn">
        <h2>What I've Learned</h2>
        <h3>Python Programming</h3>
        <p>I've learned how to create simple programs and games using Python. Recently, I built a fun snake game and explored how to work with libraries like Tkinter and random.</p>

        <h3>Robotics</h3>
        <p>I'm currently learning about robotics. I started with a simple remote-controlled car and am exploring how motors and sensors work to build my first robot!</p>

        <h3>Science Projects</h3>
        <p>I love experimenting with science! One of my projects was creating carbon dioxide and carbonated water. I'm excited to try more fun chemistry experiments in the future.</p>
